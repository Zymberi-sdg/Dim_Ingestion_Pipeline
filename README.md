# Data Processing Pipeline Tutorial with Apache Spark and Scala

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial where you'll learn how to build a data processing pipeline using Apache Spark and Scala. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll focus on transforming and joining multiple dimension tables, such as `dim_address`, `dim_store`, and `dim_calendar`.

You will gain experience in setting up the Spark environment, structuring Spark jobs, and applying various data transformations like filtering, renaming columns, and performing efficient joins across large datasets.
